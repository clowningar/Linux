# Linux
Developing&nbsp;<em><strong>Free</strong></em>&nbsp;LPIC 1-3 &amp; Dev Ops courses in Linux, 
 to prepare for these certifications. I have a Linux Fundamental course http://worldmentoringacademy.com/www/index.php?ctg=lesson_info&lessons_ID=1162. If you have any ideas, support material or
hardware kits that can be used to do hand's on learning, would you be so kind to forward it for me? 
Or Sys Ops that would make surplus hardware avail after hours for students. 
I'm developing a list of interested Students &amp; after hours sites for Hands on Learning https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1CR51fs3r5SHI2a2YIfaDxSlTTtAYpFdIm-holb57whU/viewform?usp=send_form. 
Please share this project with anyone that might gain something from this.
